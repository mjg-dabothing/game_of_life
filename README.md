#Conway's Game of Life
Developed in Ruby 1.8.7 on a Linux Mint virtualbox.
Conway's Game of Life, with edge wrap.
About 90% developed on 6 May 2014. Finished up 7 May 2014.
Uses ncurses as described in original instructions.
To run: "ruby life_ncurses_script.rb"
To run unit tests: "ruby game_of_life_test.rb"
Pretty straightforward and simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
No gems used, just pure ruby.
GameOfLife class initializes each space randomly to 0 or 1 and then runs a step of the simulation whenever evolve is called.
Note: I didn't know Ruby at all before this.
